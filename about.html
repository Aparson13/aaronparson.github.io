     <p>As a Computer Science major with an Applied Mathematics minor at the UVA School of Engineering, I am reaching out to express my interest in opportunities within the field of data science and analytics. I have acquired strong programming skills in languages such as R, Python, Java, C++, and PostgreSQL through my coursework. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a Data Science intern at Effectv, a subsidiary company of Comcast specializing in advertising. In this role, I am focused on enhancing the performance of a look-alike model for underrepresented subgroups by investigating various data augmentation techniques. Additionally, I am exploring methods to create meaningful encodings of categorical features to improve the availability of inputs for machine learning models. In my position as a Federated Machine Learning researcher with the UVA Computer Science Department, I am part of a team working on implementing a multi-party machine learning framework. We are addressing critical challenges related to privacy, fairness, statistical heterogeneity, and hardware heterogeneity. A notable achievement in this project was successfully integrating simulation code into the FedMl platform, which resulted in the creation of a synchronous reinforcement learning environment. During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to conduct mentored Data Science research on Virginia Court records, focusing on identifying race-based disparities within the Virginia Criminal Justice System. By utilizing techniques such as Cross Tabular Analysis and Random Forest Machine Learning models, I gained insights into the factors contributing to these disparities. I compiled the findings into a comprehensive report for the Legal Aid Justice Center, providing evidential data to support efforts for policy reform.
Furthermore, I have practical experience in IT support through my role at YES Behavioral Health, where I tackled technical issues and effectively communicated instructions to clients, resulting in optimized technological outcomes. Additionally, as a technical instructor for the Moore Legacy Foundation, I designed and taught technology-related classes to a diverse group of students ranging from 6th to 12th grade, with the aim of promoting STEM and IT opportunities among minority students.I am excited to apply my skills, passion for data science, and diverse experiences to make a meaningful impact in a challenging and innovative environment. I believe my academic background, research accomplishments, and practical experiences make me a strong candidate for data science positions. Thank you for considering my application.
